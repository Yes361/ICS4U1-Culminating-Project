[DREAM – FAINTLY CELESTIAL, WARM LIGHT]
The air is thick with the scent of flowers — sweet, but not cloying. Moonlight filters through an impossible garden, its petals glowing faintly with alchemical sigils.

[Seraphina]
(softly)
“Your arrival was… unexpected.”

A pause. She’s kneeling beside a bed of white luminae — blossoms that shimmer like stars. Her face is hard to make out.

[Seraphina]
“There’s a current beneath this place. Pulling all of us toward something. You don’t feel it yet — but you will.”
(beat)
“When the weight presses in, don’t trust the silence.”

She turns, finally looking Elliot in the eyes — and for a heartbeat, her expression is almost sad.

[Seraphina]
“I hope… you don’t end up like me.”

A flower bursts into light. And everything is gone.
☀️ Awakening – Dorm Room, Morning
Curtains shift in the breeze. Dust motes catch the early sun. A faint pulse of energy hums in the distance — like the heartbeat of the academy itself.

[Jasper]
(grinning)
“Well, well. Sleeping Beauty awakens.”

[Selene]
“Try not to scare him, Jasper. He’s probably still echoing with transit static.”

[Sucrose]
(quietly, near the window)
“…You’re awake. That’s good.”

[Jasper]
“Also good: I win the bet. He’s not a drooler.”

[Selene]
“Yet.”

[Elliot]
(voice slightly groggy)
“…What… is this place?”

[Sucrose]
“It’s your dorm. You arrived late — resonance irregularities, they said. Happens sometimes.”

[Selene]
“Don’t worry, no one remembers how they got here. First day weirdness is practically tradition.”

[Jasper]
“You’ll get used to it. Just keep your head down, don’t mix potassium with water, and maybe try not to incinerate the eastern courtyard like the last new guy.”

He flashes a grin. You’re not sure if he’s joking.

[Sucrose]
“Class begins soon. Don’t lose your schedule.”

She passes a folded slip of parchment — it pulses faintly with alchemic ink. “Introductory Assembly – Auditorium A.”
The schedule in Elliot’s hand glows faintly with a guiding rune. It flares once… then dims at a tall door engraved with the symbol for Initiation Lecture – Atrium A.

Standing just ahead of him, arms folded loosely behind her back, is the girl from earlier — Sucrose. She turns slightly as he approaches.

[Sucrose]
“…You took longer than I thought.”
(beat)
“But you found it. That’s something.”

Her gaze lingers on him for a moment — not cold, not warm. Measuring.

[Sucrose]
“This is the main lecture atrium. Professor Aziel handles everything… instruction, assessment, monitoring.”
(slight wry note)
“He doesn’t miss much.”

She pauses, gestures toward the doors.
“You might want to sit near the back. First days tend to… over-explain things.”
